# Tutorial-a-Thon-2021

This is an annotated version of the Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/) I used for my tutorial Machine Learning with Persistence Images for the 2021 Tutorial-a-Thon (https://sites.google.com/view/aatrn-tutorial-a-thon/). To run this it's probably easiest to install Anaconda and then install giotto-tda (https://giotto-ai.github.io/gtda-docs/).
